What is Vite? Why do we use it for React apps?

We use Vite to:

Fast development server: Vite is known for its
 extremely fast development server. It leverages 
 ES modules, which allows for near-instantaneous
  hot module replacement (HMR) updates during development.
   This means that developers can see their changes 
   reflected in the browser almost instantly, leading 
   to a highly efficient development workflow.

Lightweight and minimal configuration: Vite takes a 
minimalistic approach to configuration. It requires
 fewer configuration files and settings compared to
  other build tools like webpack or Create React App.
   Vite aims to provide a smooth out-of-the-box 
   experience, reducing the initial setup time
    and complexity for developers.

ESM-based build pipeline: Vite utilizes ES
 modules (ESM) as the primary module format,
  which allows for faster module resolution 
  and bundling. Instead of bundling all the code 
  into a single file during development, Vite serves 
  individual modules directly to the browser, 
  resulting in faster load times.

Support for native ES modules: Vite fully 
embraces native ES modules, allowing developers 
to use them directly in their codebase without
 the need for a bundler. This can lead to 
 cleaner and more maintainable code by utilizing
  the ES module syntax and features.

Plugin ecosystem: Vite offers a plugin-based
 architecture that allows developers to extend 
 its functionality easily. The plugin ecosystem
  around Vite has been growing rapidly, providing
   additional features, integrations, 
   and optimizations for React projects.

It's worth mentioning that Vite is not limited 
to React projects and can be used with other
 frameworks as well. However, its excellent
  performance and developer experience have
   made it particularly popular within the React community.
