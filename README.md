# Colt Steele's New Web Dev React

**Hi Everyone! As of this morning, the Web Developer Bootcamp now contains 10 new hours of content on React. You can find the new sections at the end of the course. The React content is independent of YelpCamp, so you do not need to complete the entire course before you start the new React sections. However, you definitely want to be comfortable with JavaScript before attempting anything React. Here's an overview of what the new content covers:**

- Working with JSX
- Using Vite to create React apps
- Props
- useState
- State and component design patterns
- useEffect
- Loading data via an API
- MaterialUI
- Creating controlled React forms
- Styling React components
- A bunch more stuff!
- hope you enjoy this update!

P.S. The next course update will include new TypeScript content. It's coming soon!
